A transaction is an old concept related to DBs, mostly applied to Relational DBs. A transaction is a few operations combined into a single unit, which comes with a few guaranteees that individual operations would not. These guarantees are known as ACID. The DB that implements transactions with these guarantees is called ACID-compliant. 
- ACID stands for:
	- Atomicity. This means that the transaction can either succeed entirely (commit), or fail entirely (abort). It cannot be applied partway.
	- Consistency. This is not the same consistency as in CAP theorem, or in replication. Consistency in ACID means that the transaction must not be able to push the database into a "bad" state. The definition of a "bad" state is unfortunately vague. It may mean just not being able to invalidate the schema. It may mean not being able to invalidate the application's business logic.
	- Isolation. Each transaction must be able to run as if it is the only transaction running, other transactions happening concurrently do not matter and should not be able to intermingle with each other. There are some isolation levels, some of which provide weaker and some stronger guarantees.
	- Durability. After a trasnaction has been committed, is result must be available in non-volatile memory, and must be available after a system fails and must recover. In replicated systems, it usually means that a trasaction is successful after its result has been replicated across some replicas.
