As discussed in chapter 8, solutions to the issues of distributed systems, assuming they actually can be detected, usually lie in the direction of various abstract guarantees. These tend to be broadly classified as "consistency guarantees", especially in the database domain. 
A very popular model is linearizability - being able to work with the system as though all of the transactions are happening in the same order. It makes the system extremely easy to reason about, but implementing linearizability is associated with a serious performance hit, especially in cases where network delay is big. 
A weaker model is causal consistency, which does not guarantee a totally valid order of events (some are understood to be concurrent), but preserves a logical order between events.
